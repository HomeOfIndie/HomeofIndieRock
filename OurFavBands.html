<h2>The Mysterines</h2>
  
<br>
  
<h4>
  
I'm aware, late to the party. However, glad I have come across them finally. The Mysterines. From slow sleazy rock, to heavier, more electric tracks. 

The first track I came across, 'Sink ya teeth', is definitely the best one to introduce yourself to the band. The first one I listened to, and
still my favourite by a landslide. Sink Your Teeth being their most recent release,
ahead of their next studio album due to release August this year. With this being the first one, it's hard not be excited for what's to come.
By no means is their previous album one to miss, however. Reeling. Reeling, has some bangers on it also, again, from the slower, chill listens,
to the familiar sounding catchy riffs that you'd expect to hear when watching an episode of inbetweeners. 

My favourites from Reeling include Hung up, Life's a B*tch (But I like it so much), and Under Your Skin. 

My suggestions when listening to the Mysterines for the first time would be: 'I bet you're Pretty Face', 
'Take Control', Under your Skin', and 'Skin Ya Teeth'. Once you listen to these, in that order, there's no going back.

<h2>Wunderhorse</h2>

<h4>
    
I found these through Sam Fender sharing on his Instagram his story. I was intrigued why Sam was sharing a video of a monkey slamming tambourines
(Wunderhorse album cover). Upon a quick WIKI lookup, I was more intrigued by the band due to the lead singers interesting story. 

Jacob Slater left home at 17, to move to London to explore his desire to be in a band. Jacob was the lead in the Dead Pretties,
he then started in a film about the Sex Pistols, However, then, was formed, Wunderhorse. Releasing their first studio album Cub in 2022,
which was described by NME as one of the best albums of the year. They recently supported Sam Fender on tour. Explains my discovery.
the first track I found from the band was 'Midas', a track I would have associated with the likes of Fontaines D.C. Slow, clear, Radiohead like.
I then found 'Leader of the Pack', the opposite. Incredibly catchy tune, which captures the diverse talent in the band.  

My suggestions for first listens by Wunderhorse: 'Midas', 'Epilogue', and 'Leader of the Pack'.
