<h2>Discovering Wunderhorse and the mysterines!</h2>
  
<br>

<h4>
  
If you have read our current Favourite artists blog, you will know our recent discovery of the amazing Wunderhorse and The Mysterines.

    It may be late... however what a time! The Mysterines second Album is coming out this week and we are excited. Their first album, Reeling, is great.
    My personal favourite tracks by The Mysterines are 'Sink Ya Teeth', the second release off the new Album 'Afraid of Tomorrow'. Our other favourites include,
    'Bet your Pretty face', and 'Hung up'. I recently bought tickets to see The Mysterines in Liverpool, this October, before releasing it was where they are from, making
    it all the more exciting!

    Wunderhorse have also stated that their second Album 'Midas' will be released 30th August 2024. The group recently released a song that will feature on the Album, Midas,
    and what a track to raise anticipation for the whole album. About the man who has it all, however nothing to show for it. Like a Pencil stub (As described by Wunderhorse
    lead Jacob Slater). It is a great track, and a personal favourite along with, Teal, and Leader of the Pack. Wunderhorse are playing at Leeds festival this year, and definitely
    the main group / artists motivating me to get a last-minute ticket...again! Jacob Slater is the kind of person you want to see live, from videos I have seen in small venues,
    it looks great. The energy seems to translate to the larger shows however, Wunderhorse opened St James's for Sam Fender last year, and it looked amazing.
